# How to request HTTP/2 for your hosted web server

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP2), defined in [RFC 7540](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540) improves website performance and enables a more efficient use of network resources. Unlike its predecessor, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 can handle heavy loads of resources such as images, fonts, scripts, and stylesheets which result in better load speeds.  It reduces latency by introducing header field compression and enables multiplexing, which allows the client and server to process multiple concurrent requests over the same connection.  

## Testing if your hosted site supports HTTP/2

## List of web hosting providers known to already support HTTP/2
