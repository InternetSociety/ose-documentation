# How to request TLS 1.3 from your web hosting provider

Transport Layer Security (TLS), defined in [RFC 8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446) provides communication security. Websites and client/server applications use TLS to secure communications between their servers and web browsers in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery. When you connect to a web address that starts with "https://", you are connecting using TLS. Note that some people still refer to TLS using an older name, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

TLS is currently at version 1.3. Web servers can support multiple versions, but version 1.0 (from 1999) and 1.1 (from 2006) are known to be at risk of not being secure enough. To protect your website from possible attacks against these older TLS versions, IT security guidelines recommend disabling TLS 1.0 and 1.1 on your web server and only support TLS versions 1.2 and 1.3.

## How to test if your web hosting provider is already supporting TLS 1.3

* Visit https://www.cdn77.com/tls-test
* Enter the address for your website
* The test will tell you if your site supports TLS 1.3
